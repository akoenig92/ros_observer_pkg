## Introduction
With the observer class you can handle an arbitrary number of ROS subscriber nodes at ones. I wrote it to enhance the quality of live while writing ROS Nodes which rely on the output of multiple subscriber nodes at ones. The observer requests the message type and remaps so you just have to know the names of the topics you want to subscribe to.

#ROS #Subscriber #Python

## Technology
* Python 3
* ROS Kinetic Kame
* ROS Noetic Ninjemys

## Features
* Create multiple subscribers of arbitrary number with only the names of the topics.
* Get the latest message of a specific subscriber.
* Get the point in time when the latest message was received of a specific subscriber.

Copy the package into the ```src``` folder of your catkin workspace and call ```catkin_make```out of the main folder in your the catkin workspace.

## Usage
Import the observer class:
```

```

Get the latest message of a specific topic:
